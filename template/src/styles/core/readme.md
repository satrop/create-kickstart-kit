# 👨‍🔧 Core Styles (aka “hands off!”)

These files contain the **logic, mixins, calculations, and helper systems** that power the design tokens — things like dynamic CSS variable generation, responsive calculations, and spacing logic.

---

## ⚠️ Please do not modify these files directly.

- If you need to change a value (like spacing, colors, grid sizes, etc.), head over to the `tokens/` folder.
- If you're trying to understand how something works under the hood — poke around here, but maybe pour a coffee first ☕️

---

💡 Think of `core/` as the engine room of the system. You probably don’t want to start pulling wires unless you _really_ know what they do.
